        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Road bicycles are designed to be ridden fast on smooth pavement. They have smooth, skinny tires and "drop"
          handlebars, and can be used for on-road racing. They are usually lighter than other types of bicycles. They
          can be ridden on paved trails, but most people find them uncomfortable and unstable on unpaved trails. Most
          road bikes are not capable of carrying heavy loads, so are not very suitable for commuting or touring.

          <h5 class="mb-1">Cyclocross Bikes</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Cyclocross bicycles are a special type of road bike designed to be raced on a mixed surface course
          (combination of pavement, unpaved trails, gravel, grass). They have a drop handlebar like regular road bikes,
          but the tires are a littler wider for more off-road traction, and they have a different style of brake that
          helps to prevent mud buildup in the frame. Cyclocross bicycles are sometimes called 'cross bikes or cx bikes
          for short.

          <h5 class="mb-1">Touring Bikes</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Touring bicycles are another special type of road bike. They are designed to be ridden on pavement, but are
          more durable for use on self-supported long-distance riding. They have all of the necessary mounting bolts for
          cargo racks and fenders, and although they still have a drop handlebar, they usually have a more relaxed frame
          design so that the rider is more upright, for more comfort when riding long distances for multiple days at a
          time.

          <h5 class="mb-1">Adventure Road Bikes</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Adventure Road Bicycles are one of the newest categories of bicycle. They are sometimes called all-road bikes,
          any-road bikes, or gravel bikes, and are the most versatile sub-category of road bike. Similar to cyclocross
          bikes, they have drop handlebars and the ability to use wider tires.

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_bike"

          <h5 class="mb-1">Mountain Bikes</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Mountain Bicycles are design for riding rough off-road trails. They have flat or upright handlebars, and a
          very low gear range for pedaling up steep trails. Most mountain bikes have some type of shock absorbers or
          suspension. Mountain bikes with front suspension only are called hardtails; mountain bikes with both front and
          rear suspension are called full-suspension bikes or duallies. Mountain bikes with no suspension are called
          rigid.

        <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
          <h5 class="mb-1">Hybrid Bikes</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Hybrid Bicycles were originally conceived to provide the advantages of both road bikes and mountain bikes.
          Their large, padded seats and upright handlebars provide a comfortable riding position, and are best for
          casual riding around the neighborhood or bike paths, short-distance commuting, and errands around town. They
          can be ridden on paved roads, but are not as lightweight or efficient as road bikes. They are ideal for paved
          or unpaved bike trails, but are not appropriate for rough off-road mountain bike trails.

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser_bicycle"
        class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start p-4" target="_blank">
        <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
          <h5 class="mb-1">Cruiser Bikes</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Cruiser Bicycles are similar to hybrid bikes, in that they are designed for casual riding, and have a very
          comfortable, upright riding position, and a large, comfortable seat. Cruisers usually have wide "balloon"
          tires, and handlebars that are even more upright, and in some cases, swept back compared to hybrid bikes. Most
          cruiser bikes are single-speed or 3-speed, and have the old-fashioned coaster brake (where you pedal backwards
          to stop). They can be used for short-distance commuting and errands, as long as your route is fairly flat.
          Some cruiser bike manufacturers make a wide array of colorful models available, to suit the fashion tastes of
          any bike afficionado.
